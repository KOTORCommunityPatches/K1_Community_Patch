## 1. Description:
This mod is a compilation of various bugfix mods (as well as a few original fixes) put together with the intention of fixing all the known bugs with the last official patch of KOTOR 1. A huge thanks to all of the mod authors who created these mods, and gave me permission to include them in this patch.

## 2. Install:
Run INSTALL.exe and select your desired level of installation:

* Tier 1 - This category strictly addresses bugs and other problems that probably weren't intended by the developers.
* Tier 2 - This category enhances the game experience. Restoring cut content, aesthetic changes, removing annoyances, etc. Only utilizes existing game assets. Recommended content.
* Tier 3 - This category includes modder-created content, assets ported from TSL, etc. Optional content.

The Tier you select will also install the previous Tier/s, i.e. selecting Tier 1 will only install Tier 1 content, selecting Tier 2 will install both Tier 1 and Tier 2 content, selecting Tier 3 will install all content.

## 3. Uninstall:
Given the complexity of this mod, a clean install of KOTOR is recommended. However, you can check through the installation log file if you wish to undo the changes made.
