## 1. Description:
This mod is a compilation of various bugfix mods (as well as a few original fixes) put together with the intention of fixing all the known bugs with the last official patch of KOTOR 1. A huge thanks to all of the mod authors who created these mods, and gave me permission to include them in this patch.

## 2. Install:
To install, you must run Install.exe TWICE! The first time select "Part 1" and the second time select "Part 2".

## 3. Uninstall:
Given the complexity of this mod, a clean install of KOTOR is recommended. However, you can check through the installation log file if you wish to undo the changes made.
