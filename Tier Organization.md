# Tier 3
## Enhanced Conversations
Dialogue trees have been altered to reduce repetition and improve the flow of things, and in some cases to restore cut or inaccessible content.
* Canderous would repeat dialogue if you kept him waiting after speaking to him in the Lower City cantina (reported by DarthParametric)
* Vandar repeated dialogue if you spoke to him again before investigating the ruins (reported by DarthParametric)
* Vandar’s dialogue was locked out after the player completed Dantooine
* Elora’s exposition was unnecessary if the player had already heard about Sunry's situation from Davin (with assistance from DarthParametric & ebmar)

## Visual Improvements

## Gameplay Tweaks
These changes affect the gameplay, adjusting it to function how it was intended, or at least however the KOTOR community has deemed to be fairer than what was intended.
* Calo Nord has different inventories and stats on different planets
* Droid classes’ feat gain was reversed: [Droid Feat Gain Fix 1.0](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/865-kotor-droid-feat-gain-fix/)
* It was impossible to repair HK after the _Leviathan_. While he claimed to be fully functional, if the player hadn't already completed the repairs, they could never benefit from his stat boosts. HK will now get all his stat boosts after the _Leviathan_.
