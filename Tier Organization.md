## Ported Content
Everything here involves content ported from another game.
* Dense Aliens [JC's Dense Aliens](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1290-jcs-dense-aliens-for-k1/)
* Some poor quality commoner clothes textures were replaced with improved versions ported from TSL [ISSUE #32](https://github.com/KOTORCommunityPatches/K1_Community_Patch/issues/32)
* Trandoshans lack a functioning soundset. New one created from sounds ported from TSL.

## Gameplay Tweaks
These changes affect the gameplay, adjusting it to function how it was intended, or at least however the KOTOR community has deemed to be fairer than what was intended.
* Calo Nord has different inventories and stats on different planets
* Droid classes’ feat gain was reversed: [Droid Feat Gain Fix 1.0](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/865-kotor-droid-feat-gain-fix/)
* It was impossible to repair HK after the _Leviathan_. While he claimed to be fully functional, if the player hadn't already completed the repairs, they could never benefit from his stat boosts. HK will now get all his stat boosts after the _Leviathan_.
