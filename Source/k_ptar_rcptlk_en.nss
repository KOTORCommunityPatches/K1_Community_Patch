/*	KOTOR Community Patch
	
	Fired by tar09_rcptlk.utt in tar_m09aa (Taris Sith Base - Main).
	
	This is the trigger OnEnter that fires the first time you enter the Sith
	Base, prompting a challenge from the receptionist about why you are there.
	It has been edited to jump the party into a set position, since the vanilla
	script just left them where they spawned into the module, which was fairly
	sloppy. Should prevent pathing issues for the receptionist if she is allowed
	to leave.
	
	Issue #253: 
	https://github.com/KOTORCommunityPatches/K1_Community_Patch/issues/253
